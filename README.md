# Churn-Prediction
Churn Prediction for Telecom Industry using Machine Learning Algorithms

## Objective

To propose a model that helps to predict the churning of customers based on the analysis of their historical data using Machine learning algorithms. 

## Steps Performed

1. Performed a literature review to understand the techniques and research already done in this domain.

2. Chose a dataset available from Kaggle and chose machine learning algorithms to perform the analysis on it.

3. Performed data pre-processing on the data so that more and efficient analysis can be performed.

4. Built different models on the data.

5. Calculated Performance metrics for various models implemented and compared the results to find the best model built.
