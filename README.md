# Churn-Prediction
Churn Prediction for Telecom Industry using Machine Learning Algorithms

## Objective

To propose a model that helps to predict the churning of customers based on the analysis of their historical data using Machine learning algorithms. 

## Steps Performed

1. Perform a literature review to understand the techniques and research already done in this domain.

2. Choosing a dataset available online and choosing machine learning algorithms to perform the analysis on it.

3. Performing data pre-processing on the data so that more and efficient analysis can be performed.

4. Build different models on the data.

5. Calculate Performance metrics for various models implemented and compare the results to find the best model built.
